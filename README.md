# Predictive-Text-Database
By Alec West

A small program that keeps a tree database of letters to keep track of occurrences of words. Can be trained.

To run the program, simply go to its directory and run "python asymmetrikwords.py". I used Python 2.7.10, although I believe it should work in newer versions as well.

To test the program, add commands to the bottom, where I have included example code. Alternatively, use your preferred method of unit testing python.

Notice that when testing the code visually, using printWords is preferable to using getWords, as it prints a nice string, and the printWords method uses the getWords method.
